    <h2>Food Insecurity and Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Food insecurity is a state where individuals or households lack reliable access to food with enough nutrition to meet their daily needs.</p>

    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>Our group developed a website to present our research on food security, with a focus on how food gardening can help communities like Buhle Park overcome hunger and poverty.</p>
    <p>The site aims to share relevant and evidence-based insights gathered from both local and global sources to help achieve zero hunger and zero poverty.</p>

    <h3>South Africa’s Food Security Challenge</h3>
    <p>Food insecurity is one of South Africa’s most pressing challenges, ranking 59th globally among affected countries. Our findings highlight several contributing factors, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Global warming</li>
      <li>Economic decline</li>
      <li>Viruses such as Covid-19, HIV, etc.</li>
      <li>Unemployment</li>
      <li>Rising food prices</li>
      <li>Health issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploring a Solution: Food Gardening</h3>
    <p>In response, we explored the concept of food gardening as a practical and sustainable solution. Through extensive online research, we identified successful gardening projects and strategies that support our hypothesis. These findings are summarized and presented across different sections of our website using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CALCULATIONS</li>
      <li>Videos</li>
      <li>Websites</li>
      <li>Search engines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To showcase our proof of food gardening as a successful method to combat food security.</p>

    <h3>A Tool for Action</h3>
    <p>To enhance user engagement, we also designed a simple program that allows users to input details — such as available space or crop type — and receive calculated recommendations for starting their own garden. Through the use of coding languages such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Etc...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tool helps translate our research into actionable steps for real-world application.</p>

  <section id="about" class="content-section">
    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Food security remains one of the most critical global challenges, particularly in developing countries such as South Africa. Many households face hunger and poverty due to limited access to affordable and nutritious food. The Food Security Through Garden Projects initiative aims to promote sustainable food production by encouraging communities to create, maintain, and expand food gardens.</p>

    <p>This report demonstrates how information and communication technology (ICT) can be used to support food security. The project combines knowledge from Mathematics, Communication, Programming, and Computing Fundamentals to research, analyze, and design solutions that promote community food gardening. The group explored various community and school garden initiatives, analyzed their success factors, and developed recommendations supported by digital tools such as a website and Java-based calculations.</p>

    <h3>2. Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>Many communities struggle with limited food resources, lack of income, and poor nutrition. Commercial food prices continue to rise, while access to fresh produce decreases. To achieve food security, communities need to adopt affordable, sustainable solutions. Food gardens are an effective way to provide nutritious food, generate income, and reduce dependence on external markets.</p>

    <p>However, the lack of knowledge, tools, and technological support often limits their effectiveness. This project investigates how ICT skills—especially data analysis, programming, and web development—can enhance community garden management and sustainability.</p>

    <h3>3. Aim and Objectives</h3>
    <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To use ICT knowledge and digital tools to promote and support food security through community-based garden projects.</p>

    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>To research existing community and school food gardens in South Africa.</li>
      <li>To identify variables influencing successful food gardening.</li>
      <li>To use mathematical methods to analyze and plan garden productivity.</li>
      <li>To develop simple Java programs to automate garden calculations.</li>
      <li>To create a basic website presenting findings, recommendations, and resources for communities.</li>
      <li>To demonstrate teamwork, communication, and the application of computing fundamentals throughout the project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Methodology</h3>
    <p>The group followed a structured process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research Phase:</strong> Internet searches were conducted to gather information from videos, websites, and articles about food gardens and sustainable agriculture practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis Phase:</strong> Key factors affecting food gardening were identified, such as soil type, space, water, cost, sunlight, fertilizer, and plant types.</li>
      <li><strong>Mathematical Modelling:</strong> Formulas were created to estimate yield, fertilizer use, and spacing using real examples from community gardens.</li>
      <li><strong>Programming Phase:</strong> A Java program was developed to calculate planting density, fertilizer requirements, and yield per square meter.</li>
      <li><strong>Website Development:</strong> The group created a simple website using WordPress to present the project findings and recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>Presentation and Review:</strong> The group collaborated using Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to compile the report, design visuals, and prepare for oral presentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Findings and Discussion</h3>
    <p>Research findings revealed that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Small community gardens can produce up to 40–60% of a family’s vegetable needs if managed efficiently.</li>
      <li>Proper garden layout and plant spacing improve productivity and reduce waste.</li>
      <li>Organic waste recycling and natural pest control improve soil health and reduce costs.</li>
      <li>Access to online information helps gardeners learn and share best practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Digital tools such as Excel, WordPress, and Java programs can make garden management easier. By integrating ICT into gardening, communities can track growth, plan resources, and share knowledge effectively.</p>

    <h3>6. Mathematics Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Mathematics provided the foundation for analyzing and managing garden resources. Through this project, students were able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify key variables — such as garden area, number of plants, yield per square meter, water use, and fertilizer ratio.</li>
      <li>Apply formulas and equations to determine planting density and resource needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      Yield (Y) = Plants × Yield per Plant<br>
      Fertilizer per Plant = Total Fertilizer ÷ Number of Plants
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>Use measurements and conversions to plan space efficiently.</li>
      <li>Apply basic statistics to summarize and visualize findings using Excel charts and graphs.</li>

    <p><strong>Example of pseudocode:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      Start<br>
      Input number_of_plants<br>
      Input yield_per_plant<br>
      Compute total_yield = number_of_plants * yield_per_plant<br>
      Display total_yield<br>
      End
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>Used if, switch, and loop structures to handle user choices.</li>
      <li>Implemented input validation to ensure correct data entry.</li>

  <!-- STATISTICS -->
<section id="statistics" class="content-section">
  <h2>Community Garden Statistics</h2>

  <p>
    According to <strong>Statistics South Africa (2023)</strong>, nearly 
    <strong>19.7% of South African households</strong> experience moderate to severe food insecurity.
    This means approximately <strong>3.5 million households</strong> face challenges accessing sufficient, nutritious food,
    and around <strong>6.2 million individuals</strong> regularly go without adequate meals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Community and school gardens play a vital role in addressing these challenges.
    Data from the <strong>Food & Trees for Africa (2024)</strong> report shows that over 
    <strong>1,200 active gardens</strong> nationwide now support more than 
    <strong>45,000 households</strong> and <strong>250 schools</strong>.
    Each community garden produces on average <strong>120–180 kilograms of vegetables per month</strong>,
    helping reduce food expenses by up to <strong>30%</strong> per household.
  </p>

  <p>
    In areas such as <strong>Buhle Park</strong>, <strong>Soweto</strong>, and <strong>Khayelitsha</strong>,
    garden cooperatives have increased local vegetable supply by an estimated <strong>40%</strong>.
    Studies indicate that <strong>65% of participating families</strong> report better nutrition and health,
    and <strong>25% of gardens</strong> generate small income streams through local produce sales.
  </p>

  <p>
    Environmental benefits are equally significant — community gardens improve soil quality,
    reduce waste through composting, and lower carbon emissions. For every <strong>10m²</strong> of garden space,
    about <strong>6 kg</strong> of organic waste is diverted from landfill monthly.
  </p>

  <p>
    These statistics demonstrate how small-scale food gardens strengthen community resilience,
    create employment opportunities, and support the <strong>UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>:
    <em>No Poverty (SDG 1)</em> and <em>Zero Hunger (SDG 2)</em>.
